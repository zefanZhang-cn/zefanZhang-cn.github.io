Welcome to my homepage! My name is Zefan Zhang, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Tian Bai](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1026/17630.htm) at Jilin University since 2023. Before that, I received my Master's Degree from Soochow University in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Yi Ji](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/0e/3a/c11250a527930/page.htm) and [Prof. Chunping Liu](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/f5/ff/c30505a521727/page.htm). I received my Bachelor's Degree from Zhejiang University of Technology in 2020.

My research interests include visual dialog, video question answering, medical visual question answering, and multimodal relation extraction. My research focuses on the multimodal relation interaction and multimodal event relation reasoning. Furthermore, I am also interested in research on the applications of deep learning in various scenarios, such as the legal and judicial domains.

Feel free to explore, connect, and engage with me on topics related to my research. I look forward to exchanging ideas and collaborating with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of technological advancement.

Thank you for visiting my homepage, and I hope you find my work insightful and inspiring!
