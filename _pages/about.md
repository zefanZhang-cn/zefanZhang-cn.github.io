## Introduction

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Zefan Zhang, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Tian Bai](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1026/17630.htm) at Jilin University since 2023. Before that, I received my Master's Degree from Soochow University in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Yi Ji](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/0e/3a/c11250a527930/page.htm) and [Prof. Chunping Liu](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/f5/ff/c30505a521727/page.htm). I received my Bachelor's Degree from Zhejiang University of Technology in 2020.

## Research Interests

My research interests include **visual dialog**, **video question answering**, **medical visual question answering**, and **multimodal relation extraction**. My research focuses on the **multimodal relation interaction** and **multimodal event relation reasoning** for building intelligent computer models that can reason the complex world. Furthermore, I am also interested in research on the applications of deep learning in various scenarios, such as the legal and judicial fields.  

## Research Experience

During the period of 2022.11-2023.2, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) advised by Huaying Xue. My main research content is accent conversion.
